## Documentation for Iteration 0

### Application Vision Statement

The Wave music player will allow users to playback and search for music that is stored on their mobile device. The application will focus on usability and simplicity by offering several core features including music playback, control, searching and sorting, and playlist creation.

Users will be able to manage and listen to music that is imported from their device. Songs can be played in their original order, shuffled order, or on repeat. Specific music can be found by searching for individual songs or by filtering based on song properties such as title, artist, or album. Music can be organized into user-created playlists which can then be exported if desired. Additionally, graphical themes will be available to allow users to personalize their Wave experience.

Wave will be developed for a target audience ranging from teenagers to young adults who want a simpler way of managing and listening to their music. To reflect this demographic, the application will feature a sleek and intuitive interface. Users that have a large or diverse music library are also part of the target audience. To accommodate these users, the application will provide multiple ways of sorting and searching for music, an important feature for music fanatics.

The users of Wave will find that the application provides a large improvement over other complicated and confusing music management tools. With a focus on simplicity, new users will be able to easily learn the functionality of the application and search for music within their library quickly. In addition to a focus on learnability, the application will provide users with a way to forward their favourite tracks to others by allowing them to export their music, either as a list of songs contained in a playlist or their entire song library. Lastly, users can customize the visual theme of the application to better suit their personal preferences.

The application will be considered successful when the following criteria are met. The first metric we are interested in is the stability of the application, especially during demanding tasks such as scrolling, searching, and sorting large music libraries. The stability of the application will be measured by how often the user’s application crashes during 12-hour usage periods. This criteria will be considered a success if the user experiences less than one crash per 12-hour usage periods. Lastly, the application will be considered successful if it remains installed on a user’s device for four months. To ensure that this metric is meaningful, a goal of an average usage of 30 minutes per day throughout the four-month retention period will be set.
