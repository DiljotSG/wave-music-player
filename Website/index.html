          <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Wave music player will allow users to playback and search for music that is stored on their mobile device. The application will focus on usability and simplicity by offering several core features including music playback, control, searching and sorting, and playlist creation.</p>
          <p class="lead">Users will be able to manage and listen to music that is imported from their device. Songs can be played in their original order, shuffled order, or on repeat. Specific music can be found by searching for individual songs or by filtering based on song properties such as title, artist, or album. Music can be organized into user-created playlists which can then be exported if desired. Additionally, graphical themes will be available to allow users to personalize their Wave experience.</p>
          <p class="lead">Wave will be developed for a target audience ranging from teenagers to young adults who want a simpler way of managing and listening to their music. To reflect this demographic, the application will feature a sleek and intuitive interface. Users that have a large or diverse music library are also part of the target audience. To accommodate these users, the application will provide multiple ways of sorting and searching for music, an important feature for music fanatics.</p>
          <p class="lead">The users of Wave will find that the application provides a large improvement over other complicated and confusing music management tools. With a focus on simplicity, new users will be able to easily learn the functionality of the application and search for music within their library quickly. In addition to a focus on learnability, the application will provide users with a way to forward their favourite tracks to others by allowing them to export their music, either as a list of songs contained in a playlist or their entire song library. Lastly, users can customize the visual theme of the application to better suit their personal preferences.</p>  
          <p class="lead">The application will be considered successful when the following criteria are met. The first metric we are interested in is the stability of the application, especially during demanding tasks such as scrolling, searching, and sorting large music libraries. The stability of the application will be measured by how often the user’s application crashes during 12-hour usage periods. This criteria will be considered a success if the user experiences less than one crash per 12-hour usage periods. Lastly, the application will be considered successful if it remains installed on a user’s device for four months. To ensure that this metric is meaningful, a goal of an average usage of 30 minutes per day throughout the four-month retention period will be set.</p>

          <h2>Major Functionality Overview</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            One of the major functionalities that Wave Music provides is being able to navigate a music library with many songs fast and efficiently. This is made possible with the ability to display your music filtered by song name, artist, album, user-made playlist, or songs you have liked. The custom playlist feature can be used to create and name a new playlist and add any songs from the library to it, allowing you to listen to that set of songs later at any point. After a playlist is created, songs can be added to the existing playlist or removed from the playlist. Wave Music also provides a music shuffle option so users can turn song playback shuffling on or off if they desire. The music playback control allows for music to be played/paused as well as skipping ahead to the next song or back to the previous song. Another feature Wave Music has is searching, which allows for any song in the library to be searched for using a song, artist, or album name.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <h5>What went well</h5>
            <p class="lead">By the end of iteration 2 Wave Music was stable and free from major bugs or crashes. We were able to achieve this because everyone was readily willing to help others with tasks that were not assigned to them. Because of this, we were able to complete almost all of the assigned user stories for iteration 2, only pushing one user story to iteration 3. The architecture and design of Wave Music also went well. The architecture design is organized, and the code was separated into layers that logically make sense.</p>
            <p class="lead">Throughout the development of Wave Music, our team has been very effective in communicating with each other in a timely manner. Specifically, when team members are working on different areas of the project, communication between each other helped improve our efficiency and avoided collaboration headaches. Our initial architecture design has essentially remained unchanged which means we did a good job of estimating the requirements Wave Music would need before we began development.</p></p>
            
            <h5>Opportunities for improvement</h5>
            <p class="lead">Although the architectural layers in the project were separated, the coupling between the persistence and presentation layers was too high. This required us to make some major refactoring changes to reduce coupling and allow for easier future modifications. This was likely due to lack of foresight and experience, but the tight time constraints also contributed to this occurring. We also greatly misjudged the estimated time it would take to implement the database and persistence layer, even though the estimate was already a large chunk of time. This estimate may have been met if not for the unforeseen refactoring changes that were required.</p>
            
            <h5>What took the most time/least/any surprises</h5>
            <p class="lead">Implementing the database took much more time than first estimated because of a method calling order issue that initialized the database and the main Activity in the incorrect order.</p>
            
            <h5>Change in project direction</h5>
            <p class="lead">Overall, the vision of Wave Music did not change at all but the scope of the features we could implement had to be reduced due to resource constraints. During our initial planning phase, we did not dedicate any time to designing a specific UI interface and layout and therefore the current iteration of Wave Music looks different than what each team member had initially envisioned in their mind. Although the appearance of Wave Music may be different than initially thought, all of the chosen features and user stories have been implemented successfully.</p>
            
            <h5>What did you learn about team or large project development?</h5>
            <p class="lead">We learned that it is difficult to develop a project when team members have competing priorities and cannot focus entirely on the project. This can lead to difficulties with technical debt as developers are more inclined to quickly push out a working fix, even if it is not the best solution, due to limited time. We also learned that it is very important to communicate what portion of the project you are working on. Without doing so, a lot of unanticipated development time can be added due to components being developed independently and not interacting with other components as expected.</p>

          <h5>Tyler Loewen</h5>
          <p>Throughout this project I have developed and practiced my database related skills by implementing a large portion of Wave Music's database.</p>
          
          <h5>Diljot Garcha</h5>
          <p>This project taught me lots about how important communication among your team can be. I was able to continue to grow my skills and learn new things related to Android development. One extremly interesting challenge occured during our second iteration when we were requiring the front-end to use dependency inversion to depend on the backend's interface. This had many obstacles and required us to re-think our application's front-end architecture.</p>
          
          <h5>Lukas Timmerman</h5>
          <p>Working on this project taught me to think more about how to write code which will be easy for others to interface with. I also learned the value of starting with the simplest implementation possible when fulfilling the requirement of a feature or user story.</p>
          
          <h5>Jiehao Luo</h5>
          <p>I have learned knowledge of implementing UI, interaction between front-end and back-end, writing acceptance tests and the ideal structure of an application.</p>
